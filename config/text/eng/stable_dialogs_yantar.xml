        <string id = "yantar_general_ucheniy_story_24"> <text>I should have, but I didn't... It is difficult for me to speak about this awful tragedy. Many of my friends and colleagues died... On the other hand, two years have passed since... But if it interests you so much, then perhaps, I shall tell the story. As I already said, it was two years ago. And it all began with the scientific congress in Berlin of which the main study was, in fact, the Zone and its influence on the environment. It has been as a result decided to equip scientific expedition to the Zone, headed by leading scientific experts, with the purpose of gathering information and studying of the nature of the Zone. Soon, sponsors appeared, the Ukrainian government has agreed with everything and after three months of preparation on a military base on the edge of Chernobyl, the expedition had begun. All the leading scientists of all the world have gathered then: physicists, chemists, biologists and others.</text>

        <string id = "yantar_general_ucheniy_story_25"> <text>Go on.</text>
        </string>
        <string id = "yantar_general_ucheniy_story_26"> <text>A lot of equipment had been bought for that expedition: Various devices, mobile laboratories, protective suits and a much more. Regards to the protection, the government had sent two troops of Spetsnaz and special ATCs with the expedition team. there were also a few stalkers that had conducted the expedition, interpreters and even journalists. So, after two weeks of instructions and preparations the expedition had been sent into the Zone, to Town-32. And imagine what happened! Literally one day before the expedition I became ill and had to spend four days in a hospital, which had actually saved my life. You wouldn't know how sad I was then, how jealous I was of my colleagues... I was promised that as soon as I'd recover I would be sent to the scientific camp in a helicopter. Meanwhile, the expedition has reached Town-32. A mobile laboratory, similar to the one we're in now, had been carried there with a helicopter, the connection with the base was set up and the research had begun. At first, all went as planned. They started to measure the level of radiation, to investigate features of different anomalies, and chemical compounds of artefacts. Every day we received regular messages from camp about new finds and explorations - nobody doubted the success of the expedition. And I in the meantime laid on a cot in an infirmary... </text>
        </string>
        <string id = "yantar_general_ucheniy_story_27"> <text> Then what happened? </text>
        </string>
        <string id = "yantar_general_ucheniy_story_28"> <text> But soon in camp strange things started happening. At first they noticed excessive aggression and irritability from members of the team, everyone just assumed it was from the constant work. After that, two Soldiers had dissapeared. In three days after the beginning of expedition, we had received a message that one of scientists, Professor Rosenberg, being in excessively excited condition, had committed suicide, put a pistol to his mouth. This news shocked us beyond belief! And in two days the radio-message with camp has broken. We stayed in full bewilderment, soon though, we decided to send a helicopter to the camp, but because of bad weather it was not possible. We had to wait only. In a few days we received the message from two Stalkers who claim to of saw a group of people on an ATC at the Rotten Wood, at night, and they got into an ambush of gangsters. Militarians immediately sent there Spetznaz troops. Other then this I can add only one more thing: The ambush was done by three participants of expedition, they hid in the woods and jumped them. When we found them, they were more similar to animals, than to people - wild, intimidated, torn off from reality. They were reminescent of patients at a psychiatric hospital... It was hard to believe that one week ago they were normal people. It took little over a month, just to get them to stop jabbering. biting, and partially restore some of their mind. </text>
        </string>
        <string id = "yantar_general_ucheniy_story_29"> <text> And what was the result? </text>
        </string>
        <string id = "yantar_general_ucheniy_story_291"> <text> Having analysed an event and the stories  of the survivors, the commission has come to a conclusion, the reason for the destruction of the expedition team was deemed from "Psychotropic radiation" of unprecedented power which, in the Zone, has been nicknamed "выжигателeм brains". As a result of exposure to this phenomenon, the teams mentality had started to collapse: There was a unprecedented aggression, furiousness and wildness. One could not cope with such mental loading and a few had killed themselves, as poor professor Rosenberg had done. Some people gave vent to the aggression on others, attacked them and killed them, like mad animals. Mutants have appeared there in time, having taken advantage of the absence of protection. Those who didn't go completely gone mad, tried to return on ATCs, but halfway got caught up in an ambush of gangsters and were killed in the firing. And so, the expedition in City-32 was lost... Since then I have sworn to not leave the Zone, yet I shall not investigate this fucked up radiation, even though I doubt I'll find some protection against it... So, Marked One, I'm spending my work-time on your discussions. </text>

        <string id = "yantar_general_ucheniy_story_292"> <text> Yes-yes, I wont bug you for long, professor... </text>

        </string>
        <string id = "yantar_general_ucheniy_story_33"> <text> Well then ask better him, I now do not have time for stories. </text>
        </string>
        <string id = "yantar_general_ucheniy_story2_0"> <text> Professor, do you have any useful info on mutants? </text>
        </string>
        <string id = "yantar_general_ucheniy_story2_1"> <text> Yes, certainly - here Kruglov's last report on poltergeists. </text>
        </string>
        <string id = "yantar_general_ucheniy_story2_2"> <text> Its very interesting, I heard about them earlier. </text>
        </string>
        <string id = "yantar_general_ucheniy_story2_3"> <text> So. Heres what we know about poltergeists: \n1. Presumably they are Stalkers who were exposed to high levels of some sort of Emmisions. They have an extreme mastery at telepathy, you know what I mean? They can take control over, animals, mutants, its a scary business. \n2. Unfortunately they are invisible to the naked eye, According to witnesses, they usually have an auro of sparks or fiery formations. It is not known if it is possible to survive the process of being taken over by one, as well as, if it is evem possible to kill them. \n3. Telekinetic abilities vary. They're known to throw subjects, from small things up to solid iron doors. \n4. Oddly enough, Controllers can form other mutants telepathically in some way. For example take a Poltergeist.  After the telepathy takes place, a controller can be formed, Supposedly the person was under influence of the poltergeist for a long time where the reason of the poltergeist and the person are weaved, and during any moment, the controller throws out the poltergeist from the consciousness. Then the controller resides as a burer. Information was received from scientists in the center of a zone, a connection which was gone 2 years ago. \n5. Presumably, live in vaults though influence is revealed on all Zone.\n6. Analysis of controller's energy has found out energy connection with the supreme reason. Presumably, the poltergeist. Means, the poltergeist can be killed having disturbed a power balance of his essence... </text>
