		<text>The 7.62x54mmR is a Russian rifle cartridge dating back to 1891. Originally designed for the bolt-action Mosin-Nagant rifle, it was used during the late Tsarist era and throughout the Soviet period to the present day, in machine guns and rifles such as the SVT-40. This cartridges remains one of the few standard issue rimmed cartridges still in military use. The American Winchester Model 1895 was also chambered for this cartridge per a contract with the Russian government. The 7.62x54mmR is still in use by the Russian military in the Dragunov and other sniper rifles and some modern machine guns such as the PKM. In addition, it is used in the Romanian PSL sniper rifle, Yugoslavian M76, and the Chinese NDM-86 Dragunov variant. Historically, the round was known as the "7.62mm Russian" (and is still often referred to as such colloquially), but the "R" in the modern designation (7.62x54R) stands for Rimmed, in line with standard C.I.P designations. The name is sometimes confused with the "7.62 Soviet" round, which refers to the 7.62x39mm cartridge used in the SKS and AK-47 rifles.</text>

        <text>Self-made flamethrower by a Freedom member Screw. It is loaded with a two-component mixture made of colloid gas type 'F' and products of oil. This mixture ignites in air so the apparatus is pretty simple. However, because the mixture reacts so vigorously there are details in the apparatus that have been made of hi-tech anti-corrosion materials that could only be produced in a laboratory environment. Also, the only person that knows the secret of production of the mixture is Screw. Because of that the flamethrower did not become a device used by masses, even taking in account that it is one of the most powerful weapons in the Zone.</text>

		<text>In 1961 the PK/PKS machine gun ('Kalashnikov/machine gun Kalashnikov mounted machine gun', Index 6P3) was adopted for service on the basis of which were developed later on the PKB machine gun intended for armored personnel carriers and the PKT machine gun intended for tanks. In 1969 the PKM (6P6) modernized machine gun with reduced weight by 1.5 kg and a number of changes: the ribs of the barrel were removed, flash suppressor, operating handle, buttplate and trigger guard were changed while the receiver cover was reinforced and introduced the folded shoulder rest. The machine gun features the rapidly removed barrel, it is a gas-operated weapon with the gas-regulator and the barrel locked by the bolt rotation. The operating handle is arranged to the right and remains stationary during the fire. The firing mechanism intended only for automatic mode of fire. The fire is delivered from the rear sear. The thumb safety locks the trigger. The machine gun is fed from the cartridge-belt activated by the lever mechanism located to the right. The feeding of cartridges from the belt link is not straight. The ports of the receiver and the magazine are covered by the spring-actuated shields.</text>
